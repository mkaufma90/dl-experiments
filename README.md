## Intro
Word2vec-Dependencies is an attempt to implement [Dependency-Based Word Embeddings](https://levyomer.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/dependency-based-word-embeddings-acl-2014.pdf) using Keras/NumPy. This paper describes the skip-gram model of word2vec, but using dependency parses as context, instead of words.

This is for my own edification, and not production grade.
