### Implementation
* Add hierchical softmax 
* add negative sampling (the paper uses 15)
* Think about if ADAM is the best optimizer 
* Add extrinsic evaluation from paper by ranking on sim words WordSim353 dataset (Finkelstein et al., 2002; Agirre et al., 2009)

### Idea extensions
* Can there be an input vector that represents BoW contexts and dep contexts
	* Input = word, dep contextâ€™s, w-1, w-2, w+1,w+2 (how to deal with dynamic size)

* Combine this with CharRNN/Image caption generating techniques . 
	* Input= word + dependency
	* Output= sentences where those dependencies are manifested
	* Example: astronaut + dobj_flies = a sentence about an astronaut flying  

* Clustering based on word2vec/word2vecf as 2 separate tunable features (someone has probably done this)


* Use this to detect phrasal verbs?
